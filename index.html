		<h1>Sports</h1>
		<h3>Big sport headlines this month. In the NFL, the Green Bay Packers star quarterback Aaron Rodgers, one of the best in the league, broke his collarbone and is expected to be out for almost the whole season. Now Packers backup quarterback Brett Hundley, who is a third round pick from UCLA, will have to stepp up and play well, with the whole Packer franchise depending on him. In the NBA, the predicted power rankings from ESPN have been released, with the Warriors ranked first and the Cavaliers ranked second. One big surprise is that the Bulls are ranked last even when they had an even record last season, 41-41.
